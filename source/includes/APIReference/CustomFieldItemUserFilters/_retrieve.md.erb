## Retrieve Custom Field Item User Filters

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/CustomFieldItemUserFilters/Examples/retrieve.tmpl.erb" %>

Retrieves a list of all customfielditem filters associated with a user or group with options to narrow down the results.

Custom field item filters are used to limit the choices that should be made available for selecting customfielditems for a particular customfield based on a user. If filtered items exist for a given user or user's group the choices for the indicated customfield should be limited to those customfielditems only.

Please note that users can belong to groups and that groups can have filtered items. When requesting filtered items for a user, you can pass the 'include_user_group' option to return the `customfielditem_user_filters` for both the user and their assigned group.
