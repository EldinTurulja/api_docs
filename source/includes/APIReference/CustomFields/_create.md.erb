### Properties
_Pass an array of customfield objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **name**<br/>required | _String_ | The name of this customfield. |
| **required**<br/>optional | _Boolean_ | Default: `true`. If true, a non-null value must be selected for this customfield when it appears on a timesheet. |
| **active**<br/>optional | _Boolean_ | Default: `true`. If false, this `customfield` is considered archived and will not be visible or usable. |
| **applies_to**<br/>required | _String_ | Default: `timesheet`. Allowed values: 'timesheet'. Specify that this `customfield` should appear on timesheets (additional customfield types may be supported in the future). |
| **type**<br/>required | _String_ | Allowed values: 'managed-list', 'free-form'.  A managed-list customfield is intended to be displayed as a dropdown list, where each 'option' is a customfielditem. A 'free-form' customfield supports text entry and does not require a collection of customfielditems to accompany it. |
| **show_to_all**<br/>optional | _Boolean_ | Default: `true`.  Declares whether this customfield should be shown on timesheets regardless of the jobcode chosen. If false, it will only appear when the chosen jobcode for a timesheet has been associated with this field. |
| **short_code**<br/>optional | _String_ | Default: `""` (none). This is a shortened code or alias that is associated with the customfield. It may only consist of letters and numbers. If not provided, an alias will be auto-generated.

For a full list of the properties that may be set on a customfield, see [The Custom Field Object](#the-custom-field-object).

### Status Codes
Each customfield that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether
the customfield was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a customfield, there may also be an additional
field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
