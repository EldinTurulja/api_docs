## Update Custom Fields

<%= partial "includes/APIReference/CustomFields/Examples/update.tmpl.erb" %>

Edit one or more customfields.

### HTTP Request

<img src="images/put.png" alt="put"/><api>https://rest.tsheets.com/api/v1/customfields</api>

### Properties
_Pass an array of customfield objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **id**<br/>required | _Int_ | Id of the customfield. |

All other `read-write` properties defined on a [Custom Field](#the-custom-field-object) object may be passed in to the request with a new value in order to change it. If the value passed in is the same as it was previously, or if a particular property is not passed in at all, it will be ignored.

**Note:** The `required_customfields` property can't be modified through the API, but _can_ be modified through the TSheets web app when logged in as an admin user.

### Status Codes
Each customfield that is edited will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the customfield was edited successfully. If there was a problem editing a customfield, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Customfield was edited successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this customfield. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |

<aside class="notice">
The maximum batch size is <i>50</i> customfields. If exceeded, a <code class="standout">413: Request entity too large</code> HTTP response will be returned.
